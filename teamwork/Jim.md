Meyes Briggs type: ENFP

1.What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?

We all do our best to achieve the expectations and ideal scores.

2.What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?

Learning more related knowledge and finishing my part of job on time. AND make contributions to team work when teammates need me.

3.What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?

Obstacles may be the new knowledge for the assignment and the teamwork style to finish it.

4.What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?

I think the best is each individual in a group has the same expectation for the course, or it will lead to the uneven distribution of responsibilities and effects. Sorts of unfair.

5.Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?
Acceptable when one indeed devotes more into the work, other cases, better be the same.

6.How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?
It depends. Typically 8 - 12 hours per week.

7.How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?

It depends. Individual who are good at or interested in one field should be considered to finish that part.

8.What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?

If the action has serious outcomes, that person should take more responsibility.

9.What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?

Better handle it during the regular meeting. For example, we can adapt to the better one.

10.How will you deal with different work habits of team members?

I am acceptable for most habits. Absolutely we can adapt to each other.

11.Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?

For sure.

12.How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?

Once a week. can be more if work is more.

13.Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?

It is the best case. But things depend on the specific situations.

14.What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?

If that happens, one can follow the majority. However, I think we can easily reach an agreement.

15.How often will you rotate the facilitator position? How will you decide on whose turn it is to facilitate?

I will try my best to motivate the work. Since we all have enthusiasm for the work, I think that won’t be a problem.

16.What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?

If it is helpful, we can follow that. But the best case is every one has a chance to speak in the group.

17.What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?

Probably take more job that other members aren’t able to finish on time. It is really hard for me to figure out a practical way to deal with this situation.

18.Is it generally easier to reach you by text, email, vmail or something else? What hours?

Yes. Except sleeping during the weekdays.
