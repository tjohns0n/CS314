Meyes Briggs type: INFP 

1. We will complete the project, including the additional honors option work. We will have a deeper understanding of programming and teamwork.

2. I want to have a successful team project where I don't have to pick up the slack of other members. I hope to find healthier ways to work in a team than I am used to in school team projects.

3. Time is a major factor. Lack of communication or motivation could also hurt the project.

4. We'll have to have a meeting where we can hopefully convince the "B" team member to put in the extra bit of work to achieve an A. If we can't convince them, then I may have to put in more work to try and boost the grade.

5. I think it's acceptable up to a point. However, one team member should not become too controlling or try and do all of the work.

6. Around 8 hours a week

7. I think we already have a vague idea of each other's strengths and weaknesses. We'll start out in our strong areas to develop a good base to help each other out when we need to switch who works on what.

8. If it only happens once or twice, that's acceptable. If it becomes a regular thing, I'll try to get an understanding of why it's happening. If we can't find a solution, I may have to talk to Dave.

9. If there's not a lot of time left, I may end up putting in extra work to polish things and then show my team members why I think the work was necessary. If I'm the one with a lower standard of quality, I would like to have a meeting where we reexamine the Scrum goals and project requirements.

10. Having regular meetings will be a big help. Additionally, having multiple, smaller Scrum goals will help us break the project into parts that should accommodate everyone's workflow. 

11. Yes

12. At least once a week, maybe more if we're struggling with an aspect of the assignment.

13. For large redesigns of code or solutions, I think approval is necessary. Minor changes shouldn't need approval.

14. If it's covered by the project requirements, we must lean towards whoever is more in line with those requirements. For other disagreements, I think we should move forward with the majority in most cases.

15. We'll probably change the facilitator for each major chunk of the assignment. It would make sense for the first facilitator to be a volunteer, and then rotate after that so everyone gets a go at it.

16. If it's a healthy leadership, I don't think action is necessary. If they're becoming overbearing and hurting the development process, the team members feeling dominated need to speak up. We should all have an understanding of each other's feelings on the team structure.

17. If the other team members have given facilitation a try and are struggling with it, then I wouldn't mind.

18. Text is the best way to reach me throughout the day. While we're working, Slack or another chat program would be the most productive. I only check my email a couple of times a day but is a nice means of communication for less pressing discussions. I'm free from 9 in the morning to midnight on Wednesday and Friday, at 6 or later on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday, but will be fairly slow to reply to texts/chats on weekends due to work.
